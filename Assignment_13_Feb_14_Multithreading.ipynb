    "##### WHAT?\n",
    "* If you wish to save time and improve performance, you should use multithreading in Python.\n",
    "* Multithreading in Python is a popular technique that enables multiple tasks to be executed simultaneously. In simple words, the ability of a processor to execute multiple threads simultaneously is known as multithreading.\n",
    "* Python multithreading facilitates sharing data space and resources of multiple threads with the main thread. It allows efficient and easy communication between the threads.\n",
    "* It is a technique where a process spawns multiple threads simultaneously.Python multithreading implements concurrency. It gives the illusion that they are running parallelly, but they work in a concurrent manner.\n",
    "* In multithreading, the GIL or Global Interpreter Lock prevents the threads from running simultaneously.\n",
    "##### WHY?\n",
    "* If you wish to break down your tasks and applications into multiple sub-tasks and then execute them simultaneously, then multithreading in Python is your best bet. \n",
    "* All important aspects such as performance, rendering, speed and time consumption will drastically be improved by using proper Python multithreading.\n",
    "* Multithreading in Python should be used only when there is no existing inter-dependency between the threads.\n",
    "##### MODULE\n",
    "* Using the *Threading* Module, threads can be handled in python."

    "* The *threading* module exposes all the methods of the thread module and provides some additional methods -\n",
    "> 1. activeCount() − Returns the number of thread objects that are active or currently alive\n",
    "> 2. currentThread() − Returns the number of thread objects in the caller's thread control (which is in the control of caller currently).\n",
    "> 3. numerate() − Returns a list of all thread objects that are currently active or alive.The list includes daemonic threads(when the program quits, all the daemon threads associated with it are killed automatically), dummy thread objects created by the current thread, and the main thread."

    "##### 1. Race condition: \n",
    "* A race condition occurs when two threads \"race\" for access to a resource. \n",
    "* For example, you may have an object that's used in two threads. If one thread tries to change a value in the objec while another tries to do the same thing, a race condition can occur. You can’t guarantee which thread will get to the object first, and thus your code could end up with some nasty bugs.\n",
    "* To prevent this kind of thing from happening, python has a special keyword called lock(). Lock is used to \"lock\" an object so that only the thread that locked it can work with it.\n",
    "##### 2. Deadlock:\n",
    "* The opposite of a race condition is a deadlock. Whereas race conditions can cause your programs to do very strange things, deadlocks can cause them to just hang and do nothing for no apparent reason.\n",
    "* A deadlock occurs when two threads lock each other’s resources.\n",
    "* For example, one thread could lock an employee object and then wait for access to a department object. A second thread could have locked the department object and be waiting for the now locked employeeobject. The net result is that both threads stop dead in the water.\n",
    "* There is no magic keyword to prevent deadlocks from happening. You just need to becareful when writing your own code to make sure that you don’t end up with a situation where a deadlock can occur.\n",
