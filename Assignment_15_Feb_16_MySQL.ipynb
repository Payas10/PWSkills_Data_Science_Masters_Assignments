    "#### WHAT?\n",
    "* A database is a collection of data that is organized, which is also called structured data. It can be accessed or stored in a computer system. It can be managed through a Database Management System (DBMS), a software used to manage data. Database refers to related data in a structured form. \n",
    "* In a database, data is organized into tables consisting of rows and columns and it is indexed so data can be updated, expanded, and deleted easily. Computer databases typically contain file records data like transactions money in one bank account to another bank account, sales and customer details, fee details of students, and product details. There are different kinds of databases, ranging from the most prevalent approach, the relational database, to a distributed database, cloud database, and NoSQL databases. \n",
